# 🏋️‍♂️ Calories Burned Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts the number of **calories burned** during exercise based on an individual's **physical attributes** and **workout parameters** using **Linear Regression**, one of the most foundational techniques in Machine Learning.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a regression model that can accurately estimate the calories burned by a person during an activity session, based on the following features:

- Gender
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Duration (minutes)
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature

This is a practical application in the **health and fitness** domain to help in fitness tracking, personalized workout plans, or calorie management systems.

## 🧪 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation

## 📊 Steps Followed in the Project

### ✅ 1. Importing Required Libraries
The project starts by importing all essential libraries for EDA, modeling, and evaluation.

### ✅ 2. Data Loading & Exploration
- The dataset is loaded and briefly inspected using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
- Key stats and feature types are examined.

### ✅ 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots and boxplots used to understand value spread.
- Correlation heatmaps used to examine relationships between variables.
- Outliers and data patterns visually identified.

### ✅ 4. Data Preprocessing
- Label Encoding performed on categorical columns (e.g., Gender).
- Features and target variable (`Calories`) are separated.
- Dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

### ✅ 5. Model Building
- A **Linear Regression** model is trained on the dataset.
- Predictions are made on the test set.

### ✅ 6. Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **R² Score** – Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.

## 📈 Results & Insights

- The linear regression model provides decent performance given the input features.
- Features like **duration**, **heart rate**, and **body temperature** have strong correlation with calorie burn.
- This shows that a simple linear model can effectively approximate calorie expenditure for basic fitness tracking.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Try advanced models (e.g., **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**) for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit** or **Flask** for real-time predictions.
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** and **feature scaling**.
- Integrate data from smartwatches or fitness devices.
